# number_guessing_game
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Program an interactive Number Guessing Game where the user selects a range of integers, and the system randomly selects a number within that range. The user's goal is to guess the number in the minimum number of attempts.


ALGORITHM
Name: The user enters name.
Range Selection: The user inputs two integers, X and Y.
Random Number Generation:The system generates a random number within the user-defined range [X, Y].
User Interaction:The user attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the system provides feedback indicating whether the guessed number is low, high, or correct.
Attempt Tracking:The system keeps track of the number of guesses the user makes.Once the user guesses the correct number, the system displays the number of attempts taken.
